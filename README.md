Brightness Control With Hand Detection OpenCV Python Source Code

Step 1. Detect Hand landmarks
Step 2. Calculate the distance between thumb tip and index finger tip.
Step 3. Map the distance of thumb tip and index finger tip with volume range. For my case, distance between thumb tip and index finger tip was within the range of 15 – 220 and the volume range was from 0 – 100.
